            <p>My name is Christina Lavingia. I have a background in content production and am a new Software Quality Assurance Engineer at Invoca, an AI-powered call-tracking and analytics platform for marketers.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working (or studying) I love to read, win at Fantasy Football, eat tacos and wine taste. Basically many of the staples of living in Santa Barbara, California.</p>
            <p>Despite being brand new to web development, one of my most proud career accomplishments has to do with launching a new website for PayJunction.</p>
            <p>I hope that UCLA's full-stack web development program helps me pursue a rich SaaS career path. It's a unique transition to be taking, but so far I'm loving making apps and fixing bugs.</p>
